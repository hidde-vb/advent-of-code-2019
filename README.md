# \*oO\* Advent of Code 2019 \*Oo\*

Advent of code solutions for 2019 in Kotlin. 

### About

The solutions are all in vanilla kotlin, so no Gradle or Maven is needed, or any other prerequisites. I'm trying to go for the most straightforward way possible. If you improvements in the code, please let me know!

*Note*: first solutions will appear on December 1.
